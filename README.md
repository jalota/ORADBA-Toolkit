# ORADBA
Oracle dba schema for Oracle - The pl/sql & sql scripts that will be the core for this specialized 'framework'. 

The front-end of this data-driven program is being developed separately. Looking to provide a rich ux from a client-side scripting language while trying to take advantage of the robust performace from pl/sql and improved database design.
